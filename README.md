## üöÄ About the Project

This project provides a robust and scalable Node.js application foundation. It's designed to be a starting point for building high-performance APIs, microservices, or full-stack applications. With a focus on best practices, modularity, and maintainability, it aims to streamline development and ensure a solid architecture from the ground up.

Whether you're building a simple CRUD API or a complex real-time system, this boilerplate offers the flexibility and tools you need to succeed.

## ‚ú® Features

Our Node.js app comes packed with essential features to get you started quickly and efficiently:

*   **‚ö° RESTful API Architecture**:
    *   Designed with a clear and consistent RESTful structure, making it easy to create, read, update, and delete resources via HTTP requests.
    *   Includes example routes and controllers for immediate development.
*   **üíæ Database Integration**:
    *   Seamless integration with popular databases (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) using powerful ORMs/ODMs like Mongoose or Sequelize.
    *   Configurable database connection management.
*   **üîí Authentication & Authorization**:
    *   Supports secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    *   Middleware for route protection and role-based access control (RBAC).
*   **‚úÖ Input Validation**:
    *   Robust request body validation using libraries like `Joi` or `express-validator` to ensure data integrity and prevent common vulnerabilities.
*   **üö® Centralized Error Handling**:
    *   A comprehensive error handling mechanism that catches unhandled exceptions and promises rejections, providing consistent error responses.
    *   Customizable error types and status codes.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration**:
    *   Utilizes `.env` files for managing environment-specific variables, keeping sensitive information out of the codebase.
*   **üß™ Unit & Integration Testing**:
    *   Pre-configured testing environment with `Jest` or `Mocha/Chai` to write effective unit and integration tests.
    *   Example tests included to guide your testing efforts.
*   **üìà Logging**:
    *   Structured logging with `Winston` or similar for better debugging and monitoring.
    *   Customizable log levels and output destinations.
*   **üßº Clean Code & Modularity**:
    *   Follows a clean code architecture with a clear separation of concerns (controllers, services, models, routes).
    *   Promotes modular and maintainable code for easier collaboration and scaling.
*   **üê≥ Docker Support (Optional)**:
    *   Includes `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerization, enabling easy deployment and consistent environments.

## üõ† Technologies Used

This project leverages a modern Node.js stack for robust and efficient development:

*   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework.
*   **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) / [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Example NoSQL/SQL database.
*   **[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) / [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) / Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for databases.
*   **[JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io/)**: For user authentication.
*   **[Bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js)**: For password hashing.
*   **[Joi](https://joi.dev/) / [Express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)**: For data validation.
*   **[Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **[Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)**: For robust logging.
*   **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) / [Mocha & Chai](https://mochajs.org/)**: For testing.
*   **[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)**: For automatic server restarts during development.
*   **[ESLint & Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: For code linting and formatting.
*   **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: For containerization (optional).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: `v16.x` or higher
    *   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*   **npm**: `v8.x` or higher (comes with Node.js)
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository
    *   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   **Database**: A running instance of your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
    *   For MongoDB, you can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or [install locally](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
    *   For PostgreSQL, you can use [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) or [install locally](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
    cd your_repository_name
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create an `.env` file:**
    Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and update the variables as needed. At minimum, configure your database connection string and application port.

    ```
    # .env file example
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    # Add other environment variables as required (e.g., API keys, SMTP settings)
    ```
    **Important:** Do not commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already ignored by `.gitignore`.

## üíª Usage

Once installed, you can run the application in different modes:

### üöÄ Running the Server

#### Development Mode

To run the server in development mode with `nodemon` (auto-restarts on file changes):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will typically start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

#### Production Mode

To run the server in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

### üß™ Running Tests

To execute the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

### üßπ Linting and Formatting

To check for linting errors and format your code:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### üê≥ Docker Usage (Optional)

If you have Docker installed, you can build and run the application in a container:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-node-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -d your-node-app
    ```
    (Ensure your `.env` variables are correctly configured for the containerized environment, or use `docker-compose` for more complex setups.)

3.  **Using Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    This will build the image (if not built) and start the application along with any linked services (like a database container) in detached mode.
